# Description Validation
### What is this validation?
This validation checks for valid description criteria such as the length of the description.

### Why do we need this validation?
The Asset Store description only allows for up to 200 characters. The validation suite needs to check the description from the package metadata because once uploaded to the publisher portal the description field is un-editable

## Errors
### Description too long
If you see this error, it means that the description of your package exceeds the limit (200 characters). Please shorten the description to 200 characters or less, then run the validation again.
